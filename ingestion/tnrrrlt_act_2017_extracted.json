To fulfil this mandatory\ncondition, legislation has to be undertaken.\n2. The purpose of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control)\nAct, 1960 Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 1960 was to regulate the rent as well as\ngive powers to the Government to take certain properties on rent at fair rent\neven against the wish of the property owner if it was desirable in the interest\nof the State or required by the Government. These provisions made long back\nwhen supply of rental accommodation was limited, real estate business had\nnot evolved and properties were vested in the hands of very few people.\n3. Now the scenario has changed. Robust real estate and availability of\nenough housing stock makes the existing rent control Act out of place. The\nexisting Act has created lot of vested interest against the landlords. Further,\nthe supply of the rental housing and growth of rental housing market has been\nseverely affected leading to growth of slums in absence of sufficient stock\nof rental houses. To tackle the problem, the new Law has to be enacted\nfor the State, after repealing the existing Tamil Nadu Building (Lease and Rent)\nControl Act, 1960.\n4. The Government have decided to enact the Tamil Nadu Regulation\nOf Right And Responsibilities Of Landlords And Tenants Act, 2017 on the\nlines of the mode bill suggested by the Government of India. The new Law\naims to regulate the rent as per the terms and conditions of the agreement\nto be entered into between the owner of the premises and the tenant. It\nalso aims to balance the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and the\ntenant and provide regulation of the rent as per the agreement.\n5. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision.\nUDUMALAI K. RADHAKRISHNAN,\nMinister for Housing and\nUrban Development."

To fulfil this mandatory\ncondition, legislation has to be undertaken.\n2. The purpose of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control)\nAct, 1960 Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 1960 was to regulate the rent as well as\ngive powers to the Government to take certain properties on rent at fair rent\neven against the wish of the property owner if it was desirable in the interest\nof the State or required by the Government. These provisions made long back\nwhen supply of rental accommodation was limited, real estate business had\nnot evolved and properties were vested in the hands of very few people.\n3. Now the scenario has changed. Robust real estate and availability of\nenough housing stock makes the existing rent control Act out of place. The\nexisting Act has created lot of vested interest against the landlords. Further,\nthe supply of the rental housing and growth of rental housing market has been\nseverely affected leading to growth of slums in absence of sufficient stock\nof rental houses. To tackle the problem, the new Law has to be enacted\nfor the State, after repealing the existing Tamil Nadu Building (Lease and Rent)\nControl Act, 1960.\n4.
